Act as a Product Manager at UBS preparing a hackathon pitch for senior leadership.

Create a professional PowerPoint presentation with a maximum of 5 slides for the following idea:

IDEA:
An AI-powered Personal Productivity Tracker Board for UBS employees (similar to GitLab Issue Boards) that integrates directly with GitLab to track, prioritize, and improve individual delivery productivity.

This solution acts as a smart personal Kanban board that allows employees to manage their GitLab issues and daily work using AI-driven prioritization and accessibility modes.

Core Features:
- Individual Productivity Tracking Dashboard
- GitLab Issue Import & Sync
- GitLab Wiki Sync
- AI Task Assistant (users can ask AI about any issue/task)
- AI-based Task Prioritization Engine
- MCP Integration for contextual productivity recommendations
- Voice-based Task Creation & Navigation
- Work Modes:
    • Normal Mode
    • Focus Mode
    • ADHD Mode (Adaptive Cognitive Support Mode)

Structure the presentation as follows:

Slide 1 – Problem Statement
Explain the challenges UBS employees face in managing multiple GitLab issues, context switching, unclear task prioritization, and productivity tracking.
